        <h2 class="black--text mb-3">Budapest</h2>
        <p class="black--text">
          Budapest is the capital city of Hungary, one of the largest cities in
          Europe and undoubtedly one of the most beautiful. It is hard to think
          of Budapest and not immediately imagine its unique landscapes with its
          elegant buildings, stone streets and castles. Budapest was founded
          about 150 years ago, as a union of three different cities named Buda,
          Pest and Ã“buda, but the streets of the city tell the history of
          Hungary for centuries, which includes Roman settlement, 150 years of
          Ottoman occupation, a thriving Austro-Hungarian Empire and also two
          wars world.
        </p>
        <p class="black--text">
          The Danube River - the beating heart of the city - not only crosses
          Budapest, it literally divides it into two parts. While the eastern
          side is relatively flat, the western side is entirely hilly - from
          there, especially from the castle hill, you can overlook the
          spectacular beauty of the city known as "the pearl on the Danube". If
          you like, you can divide Budapest in a simple way: the west side is
          where most of the important historical sites are located, while the
          east side is full of restaurants, entertainment places and shops.
        </p>
        <p class="black--text">
          Budapest is great to soak up a European atmosphere, admire the
          architecture and learn about its rich past. Among the palaces,
          churches and cathedrals you will also find memories of a vibrant
          Jewish community. For example, the Great Synagogue of Budapest, which
          is the largest in Europe and undoubtedly one of the most special
          synagogues in their design.
        </p>
        <p class="black--text">
          Along with all the historical monuments, Budapest is also a city where
          you can find relaxation and time for yourself. Beautiful and large
          parks are scattered throughout the city and the offer of hot baths is
          one of the largest in the world. In fact, Budapest holds the title of
          the hot spa capital of the world.
        </p>
        <p class="black--text">
          Don't be fooled by its elegance and history, Budapest is also a lively
          city, with irresistible culinary offerings and a vibrant nightlife. A
          huge variety of restaurants awaits you in the city, from places that
          serve Golash in the best tradition to restaurants with modern food and
          trendy cafes. The city is also known for its love of sweets, so
          prepare yourself for lots of cakes, special sweets and pastries. And
          yes, there is also strudel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="black--text">
            If you come to the city as a family, you will be happy to know that the city is prepared to entertain
            all members of the family - from the young to the old, with a
            multitude of museums, attractions and open spaces.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="black--text">
          Although it is full of attractions and very popular among tourists,
          Budapest still offers very affordable prices to its visitors. The hotels are not expensive and also restaurants and
          entertainment are priced at very reasonable prices, certainly compared
          to the rest of Europe.
