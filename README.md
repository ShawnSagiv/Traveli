### Traveli

Traveli is the solution for confused people who can't decide which trip to choose. 
Traveli give the customers the opportunity to choose the type of their dream trip, for example things they like to do during their stay, what kind of foods they like, the kind of places they like to visit, choose the weather and season they like and much more.
Moreover, Traveli will help you to expend your horizons and find places you would never think about or even know that they exist, like Bhutan, Faroe Islands, Namibia and many more, and design the perfect trip for those extraordinary places.

In this section, all the "Search Bar" components, are placed. The search bar, is like a banner, and can be found in the upper part of the main page of the website. This is basically the filter for finding the required trip. 
It includes all five major components: Dates, Destinations, Number of people, Price, VacationTypes.

### /Users/shawnsagiv/Desktop/traveli_source/src/views

This section contains all the "Secondary pages." This means, that in order to build this type of website we had to build description pages for every country/city in the world. Basically, we could not do so within our time frame, so we chose 8 major countries in order to demenstrate our case. The countries/cities are: Amsterdam, Istanbul, Budapest, Dubai, Greece, Krakow, New York, Prague.

### /Users/shawnsagiv/Desktop/traveli_source/src/router
Contains one file "index.js" which contains the routes of the links (e.g home, Amsterdam, New York) etc.
